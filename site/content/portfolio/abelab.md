OpenAnimates is an ongoing project based on the Shybo project. The project consists of playful learning activities with robots developed in collaboration with [Lorenzo Romagnoli] (http://lorenzoromagnoli.me), creative technologist, and Annalisa Gallo, manager of [10100 Percorsi] (https://10100percorsi.com). The idea is to extend the concept of trainable robots that guided the development of Shybo, for co-designing creative and playful learning experiences with robots related to school's curricular program.

A small presentation (in Italian) of the project is available on [SlideShare] (https://issuu.com/marialucelupetti/docs/presentazione_open_animates)


More details will come soon!
