This project focuses on the issue of inaccessibility in Cultural Heritage, due to lack of restoration and safety. The project has been developed for a specific context, the Royal Residence of Racconigi Castle, in Italy, where around 60% of the areas are excluded from the tour route. The proposed service allows visitors to explore remotely the inaccessible areas through Virgil, a mobile robotic platform tele-operated by the Museum Guide who is also entrusted of the cultural storytelling activity.

The project was promoted by TIM and developed in collaboration with Terre dei Savoia association.
