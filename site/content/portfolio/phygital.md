This project focuses on the screen time issue, a growing phenomenon, which may cause an increase of health issues. A new gaming framework is proposed as a step forward in the virtual-physical contamination already largely addressed in research. The system consists of a projected playground, on which people and robot(s) can physically interact. The role of the robot is enhanced entrusting it different roles, from a companion, to an adversary, to the avatar of a remote player.



The project was promoted by TIM, and developed in collaboration with Fabrizio Lamberti e Giovanni Piumatti, from DAUIN, Politecnico di Torino.

The Phygital Play gaming platform is a mixed-reality playground obtained combining a projector, two depth cameras (Microsoft Kinect v2.0) and commercial robots. The projector is used to display a virtual playground on the floor, while the depth cameras are used to track the position respectively of the players and the robots.
